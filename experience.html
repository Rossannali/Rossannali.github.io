								<h2><strong>Data Analyst  |  Feedr LTD | (May 2022- present) </strong> </h2>
								<p>A catering company – supplying food and drinks to bespoke events and work offices. </p>

								<p><strong>PROJECT: Sales Team: Sales and Forecasting- </strong> A dashboard in Power BI reporting all the important data acquired through Sales' prefered CRM platforms- forecasting the MRR and ARR on recurring deals. 
								In this project, I wrote a SQL adhoc query that served a purpose in forecasting sales and projecting accurate recurring MRR and ARR deals from the contracted start date. 
								I consolidated data from a variety of interchangeable formats to be stored, transferred and transmitted into structured data and used within the data model.  
								<p>Based on the insights of the clients current spend, I set out key market insights and performance indicators on how clients will perform and interact with the product in the future. 
									Further providing ammunition to lead the sales team to revise and increase deals that were visabily highlighted when clients were spending more than 100% of their forecasted MRR every month.
									 In addition, it drew attention to clients that needed to interact and spend more. Overall, the contracts that were revised were highly profitable and also assisted the marketing team to direct
									 promotions and other advertisements to those clients that were under performaing.
									Through out the project, I worked close with my manager and gave guidance to improve data visibility and quality </p>
									

									<p><strong>PROJECT: Operations Team: Issue Tracking - </strong>The report provided multiple purposes, it’s aim is to outline the company’s expectations and tracks Vendor’s performance and measure satisfactory levels of the consumer
										The report regularly updates and tracks the company’s activities to improve customer experiences– between the vendor and courier – and issues reported in Intercom for the Operations team. 
										With the issues reported via intercom and recorded in Google Sheets, I presented an operational dashboard in Power BI that focused on a more granular view of issues on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually basis. </p>
										<p>The data was captured through consumers written feedback, average rating scores, counts of orders and spend on goods. 
											Additionally, I worked with the developers to apply row-level security (RLS) filters that restricted data access at row level for each Vendor. the report was shared through a portal, for which Vendors were able to access to track their personal performance.</p>


								<h2><strong>Junior Data Analyst | Automutatio LTD | (May 2021- May 2022) </strong></h2>
							<p>A software that maps out data to facilitate the collection, storage and organisation of structured or unstructured data from information management systems.  </p>
							<p> <strong>PROJECT: Covid-19 Data Tracking - </strong>Whilst studying my Microsoft Certificate, I Improved the data modelling to be more efficient, cleaner and simpler to use. I used data modelling best practices – the star schema approach (waterfall),  organised and edited relationships,
								 using active and inactive relationships and a measures table. The revised data model helped optimise columns and tables to communicate the company’s information better, creating intuitive and meaningful reports. </p>
						<p>Every week I worked closely with the Director and became familiar with querying data to insert, update and manage the underlying code in Dbeaver. Alongside, SQL, I learnt HTML and CSS to update information, images, colour, borderlines, margins and text on their website. </p>
